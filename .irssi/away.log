15:10 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eguess it depends on how much storage you need

15:26 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eif you reinstall ubuntu it will wipe the drive if you choose to use the whole disk
15:26 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ehowever
15:26 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eyou could also choose to install from the ubuntu installer using the free space
15:26 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eit will resize the existing partition
15:26 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand install into a newly created partiton
15:26 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ethen
15:27 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eyou can copy over whatever data from the first partiton you want

15:27 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eyou can do whatever you want with it
15:27 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand that will leave the data intact
15:27 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand not fuck the drive
15:27 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ ehmm
15:27 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ethat what you were asking?

15:27 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eKinda
15:27 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ek
15:28 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ekinda? well what particular do you want
15:28 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eNo, that's what I was asking
15:28 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eI'm just still unsure
15:28 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eThat's all
15:28 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ewell look at it this way
15:28 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ewhen people dual boot
15:28 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eits basically the same setup
15:29 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eexcept in this case you would just ahve one working os
15:29 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eso I mean it'll work
15:29 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eWell yeah, but wouldn't that leave the busted OS on the old partition?
15:29 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eyes, but what you could do is this:
15:30 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eonce you have the newly installed os on the second partition, you can copy all the files you want onto that partition, and delete the first with the nonworking os
15:30 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eBut
15:30 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand resize the second to the whole drive
15:30 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ebut?
15:30 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eI'd rather not set myself up for the same problem
15:30 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ewell what caused it in the first place
15:30 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eNot a clue
15:30 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eBut want the OS and the media storage on separate partitions.
15:30 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eok in that case
15:31 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ewhat I would do is install onto the second partition
15:31 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand the on the first, just rm -rf /bin /etc /usr etc
15:31 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand just leave the media files you want there
15:31 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ethen you will have 2 partitions
15:31 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eone media and one os
15:32 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ethe os will just be one the second partiton instead of the first
15:32 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ ewhich doesnt matter
15:33 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eand iirc correctly you can choose how much free space you want to use for the os
15:33 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ eso you can leave however much for the media (existing) partition
15:35 c;/c7/     prole;/c7/ esee what I am saying?

18:01 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eWhile I’m sure you fancy yourself incredibly clever for “catching” me in the reviled act of plagiarism, I do believe you’ve missed my point. I was suggesting that, considering the surprising quality and humor of Mr. O’Brien’s piece, Cracked should consider re-running it with my name in place of his. This, I feel, would draw more readers to what is surely a tragically overlooked piece, worthy of more attention
18:01 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ ethan Mr. O’Brien’s unimpressive name can draw. I believe Mr. O’Brien would be honored merely by being near me, and so would gladly acquiesce. May I also add: If I ever find out who you are, Ed, and why you keep imprinting your child-like retard scrawl on my beautiful, angelic prose, I will certainly destroy you with my penis like I did that Mexican magazine, a concept which I have entirely invented just now.

01:40 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ e Re: Start Ubuntu Server 8.1 GUI There is common misconception of ex-Windows users that a special server version is needed in order to use network services. A Linux server distribution has a few minor optimizations to make it work better for large computational loads, but essentially it is exactly the same as a desktop version of Linux. There is no reason why you cannot just install a regular Ubuntu version and use that
01:40 c;/c7/ladyfizzgi;/c7/ eas a server.  If your 'server' is sitting on a desktop and has a screen and keyboard hooked up to it, then use regular Ubuntu. If your 'server' is a headless machine lurking in a dank corner of a dark data centre, then use the Server version of Ubuntu. The difference between the two is however minimal.

12:57      prole nah its straight
12:57      prole I gotta get a chair and earplugs though
12:57 skitangel3 Lol
12:58 skitangel3 We usually take a blanket and sit on the grass
12:58      prole ah
12:58      prole that works
12:59 skitangel3 I've never taken earplugs so that's on you
13:00      prole yea that didnt really sound right cuase niggas shoot outside without plugs
13:00      prole and unless you right up on that shit it should be fine
13:05 skitangel3 Wow...you can tell you've never been to one...
13:05      prole I suppose so?
13:07 skitangel3 Ok...you realize you are on the air strip which means you pretty much are right up on that shit...and we're talkin jets and shit like that
13:07      prole they take like seconds to take off and be away from you
13:07 skitangel3 But are flying right over you

13:11      prole ah
13:12      prole well yea like I said if you wanna take him one day we can do something the other
13:15 skitangel3 Ok...here's a shot in the dark...would you like to keep him tonight and spend all day tomorrow with him...I can bring him over after I pick him up from school...and you can call me whenever tomorrow to come get him
13:16      prole my dad is going out tonight so I dunno about keeping him over night I am not really comfortable with just me and jamie here
13:16      prole but I would take him for tomorrow
13:19      prole is that cool?
13:24 skitangel3 What I'm having trouble understanding is he's your son why wouldn't you feel comfortable keeping him...this is what you've been wanting
13:25      prole its not uncomfrotable keeping him its I want my dad here in case some shit go down
13:25      prole cause I've never spent a bunch of times with little kids
13:25      prole so I want someone here who knows what they are doing
13:26      prole like if my dad was going to be here tonight it would be cool
13:26      prole see what I'm saying?
13:29      prole cause you gotta remember I dont know how to change a diaper
13:29      prole I dunno whats ok to feed kids
13:29      prole like how you said I shouldnt have let him have the mountain dew
13:29      prole etc
13:30      prole then on top of that
13:30      prole hes never stayed here by himself
13:30      prole so if he wont go to sleep cause hes freaked out you're not here I wont have any backup
13:30      prole thats why I said I'd rather take him dor the day to begin with
13:30      prole cause hes never been around me without you here
13:31      prole and at least during the day I can bring him to a park or something
13:33      prole you there?
13:33 skitangel3 Yeah I'm here
13:34      prole you disagree or what?
13:34 skitangel3 As you wish
13:34      prole cause I mean I want him to stay the night just not the first time he's here by himself and without my dad here
13:35      prole once he's used to be here without you it'll be cool
13:35      prole to being  here
13:36 skitangel3 Ok...fine...however you want to do it...I knew you wouldn't go along with it anyway...so its kool
13:36      prole you understan dits not because I don't want him to right
13:37 skitangel3 yeah
13:38      prole actually I just talked to my dad and he said he'll stay

00:20      vinni i didn't go for an illegal trade though, i produce chems from a nebula cloud that feed into a plastics facility that in turn feed a handweapons factory
00:26      vinni then again FYAD might be more your spped
00:26      vinni speed*
00:27      vinni Neutral pirate group, they cause much chaos
00:34      vinni our alliance is all about trade mainly, the LIM (league of imperial merchants) we maintain a healthy ralation with legals and illegals, where ever the money is

00:41      vinni though, some have equally nice bonuses
00:42      vinni anyh ol' way, if you start in the west skaari cluster you will be close to the main empire action

Let's see, we have a president who a) vocally opposes firearms (at least he did at one point--seems like he's backing off recently, too busy spending money and having fancy dinners. George Clooney would be proud), b) is the least bi-partisan president in modern times, c) whose party controls congress, with an iron fist evident by their lack of bi-partisanship), d) whose composed of many individuals who vocally oppose firearms.
20:50      prole I can see why they're nervous. Is it justified? Sure. It is logical? Maybe. Is it racist? No.

20:20      prole One of the major tenets of Scientology is a belief that each human is inhabited by alien spirits, which L Ron Hubbard dubbed "The Space Opera". It is a basic belief of Scientology that a human being is actually an immortal spiritual being, termed a thetan, that is presently trapped on planet Earth in a "meat body." The thetan has had innumerable past lives and it is accepted in Scientology that lives preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Descriptions of space opera incidents are seen as true events by Scientologists

20:53      prole There is the small, some might say major, issue that carbon nanotubes are only microns long, and pasting them together end to end has so far proven impossible. But physics can't hold back mankind, and recently a New Hampshire based company made a man-sized blanket out of nanotubes, showing that science will always say "Fuck you" to Mother Nature when she sets boundaries.
20:53      prole So far, they have managed to make super-small computer processors and low-resistance circuitry. In the future, all bets are off. Everything from tiny supercomputers to even tinier, super-efficient batteries, to more efficient solar panels to paper-thin materials that can stop a bullet, to freaking space elevators.
20:53      prole Sunglasses hinges that never break, toasters that get the toast right every time, TV remotes where the numbers don't wear off the buttons, ceiling fans that don't vibrate. Bags of chips that never get stuck in the vending machine. Carbon nanotubes will fucking solve it all.
20:53      prole laffo
20:54 stormchase ha
20:56 stormchase as i read wiki/classic cult shit

20:59 stormchase white race/black race
20:59      prole                     In the Black man there exists two germs:  one - a Black germ, and one - a 
20:59      prole                     brown germ. 
20:59      prole                     Yacub, with his Law on Birth Control- separated the brown germ from the 
20:59      prole                     Black man and grafted it into a white by destroying the Black germ.  After 
20:59      prole                     following this process for six hundred years, the germ became white, and 
20:59      prole                     weak, and was no more original. 
20:59      prole germs.

21:39      prole That's right, our friends at the LHC project expect a lot of weird things to pop up when they start smashing atoms together, and strange matter is one such possibility. That's why scientists have written papers with boring titles such as Will Relativistic Heavy-ion Colliders Destroy Our Planet?, the rebuttals to which were basically, "Let's turn them on and find out!"
21:39      prole ha
21:40 stormchase how'd that god particle thing turn out

17:26   Run\Stop how about we just get them into a private channel, referee the argument and have them settle their shit
17:27      prole that could possibly work
17:27 stormchase they are either in the navy or marines or related to one of the entities somehow
17:27      prole worth a shot anyway
17:27 stormchase i am amazed at how they manage
17:27      prole cause polaris will pretty much do anything to keep ops
17:27 stormchase to work that in
17:27 stormchase but they do
17:27 stormchase and make it credible
17:27      prole how do you mean
17:27      prole I figured the people being tried or whatever would be in the navy/etc
17:28 stormchase like if it happens on a base or a marine or seaman gets killed or is a suspect or if they are a direct relation to
17:29   Run\Stop yeah i think hes pretty obsessed over irc
17:29      prole yea
17:30      prole oh
17:30 stormchase oh yeah and pretty much all murders at sea
17:30      prole as in on boats
17:30      prole ?
17:30      prole or on a beach or what
17:31 stormchase on boats
17:31 stormchase i'd love to know if coast guard
17:31 stormchase has an investigative branch
17:31      prole probably
17:32      prole I think the coast guard got incorporated into some other shit now though
17:32 stormchase so they can laugh at some of this
17:32      prole either the navy or the border patrol people
17:32      prole they fucked shit up with dhs
17:32 stormchase homeland security prolly
17:32      prole yea
17:32      prole its not called omeland security but it falls under them
17:34      prole In the United States, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is both a military and a law enforcement organisation. It is one of the seven components of the Uniformed services of the United States and one of the five elements of the United States Armed Forces. Its role comprises enforcement of US law, coastal defence and search and rescue.[20]
17:34      prole During peacetime the USCG falls under the administration of the United States Department of Homeland Security. During wartime, the USCG may, at the direction of the President, report to the Secretary of the Navy; its resources, however, are integrated into U.S. military operations
17:35      prole The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of seven uniformed services. It is unique among the military branches in that it has a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction both domestically and in international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set
17:35      prole so I assume it has some kind of inverstigational branch
17:35      prole or it IS one
17:35      prole cant really tell

19:02      prole yea
19:02      prole it reminds me of the quinos commercial that was funny and impressive
19:02      prole that they changed sexy to passionately
19:02      prole and removed the put it in me part
19:02 stormchase with the talking oven?
19:03      prole basically all the good parts
19:03      prole yea
19:03 stormchase yeah 
19:03 stormchase i liked the put it in me
19:03      prole same
19:03      prole the look on dudes face was priceless
19:03 stormchase made me remember the restaurant and all
19:03      prole and they just fucked it all up
19:03      prole yea
19:03      prole quiznos toasty torpedoes
19:03      prole I KNOW that shit
19:03 stormchase which is the point of an add
19:03      prole exactly
19:03      prole but you have to think of the children
19:03      prole they may think its ok to fuck ovens when they grow up
19:04 stormchase hee hee
19:04 stormchase but again
19:04      prole that was the best commerical I had seen in a long time though
19:04 stormchase only kids old enough
19:04 stormchase would even get that part
19:04      prole well
19:04      prole its the same thing where you never see kids outside anymore
19:04 stormchase if they get it the n they already know what's up
19:04      prole because parents all think some stranger is going to come molest them
19:05      prole even though the chances of it happening are astronomically low
19:05      prole the chance of a kid getting that commercial is low as fuck
19:05      prole but its 'offensive and in bad taste'
19:05 stormchase even if there's a pedo in the hood
19:05 stormchase if the kid listens to their parents
19:05 stormchase the pedo ain't gonna get him
19:05      prole yea thats true
19:05      prole but instead, kids just stay inside and get fat
19:06      prole cause I mean think about it
19:06      prole when you were a kid you went outside and played right?
19:06      prole like all summer I'd be outside all day
19:06      prole now
19:06 stormchase i mean there have been dirty ole pervs since time began
19:06      prole I never see kids out anywhere
19:06      prole you'er more likely to be raped/killed/abducted by someone in the family than a stranger
19:06 stormchase especially boys
19:06      prole by several orders of magnitude
19:06 stormchase you could send them out in the am
19:06 stormchase and never see them again til night
19:06      prole yea
19:07      prole thats how I was
19:07      prole wake up go out
19:07      prole be back around dark
19:07      prole and I was always around a clique of kids
19:07      prole I never see that shit now
19:07      prole see kids on leashes with their parents
19:07 stormchase u know that movie where the kids go out to see a dead body
19:07      prole thats  bunch of movies

19:16      prole and the reply was penis penis penis penis penis penis satan
19:16      prole and these fuckups come on talking about put a nsfw tag on there
19:16      prole a) its a fucking medical word
19:16      prole for something that all men have
19:16      prole and b) if you are worried about looking at shit that is nsfw then maybe you should be working
19:16      prole and not rbwosing the fucking internet
19:17 stormchase ha
19:17      prole http://www.flickr.com/photos/passiveaggressive/3642661392/sizes/o/
19:19 stormchase you know u sent that to me today already right?
19:19      prole couldnt remember
19:19      prole According to a New York Times/CBS poll, that point is obvious to 72 percent of the American people who favor “offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan like Medicare that would compete with private health insurance plans.”
19:19      prole It’s also reflected in a study cited by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and other insurance industry defenders saying that 119 million Americans would bolt from their private insurers to the public option if they were given the chance.
19:19      prole To put that figure in perspective, it is about two-thirds of Americans who have private insurance through their employers or as individuals. In other words, the industry's defenders say two of every three customers want out.
19:19      prole Though some analysts doubt the defection rate would reach 119 million, Grassley’s argument is that Americans would so prefer a government-run plan that it would destroy the private insurance industry – and that therefore the public option simply can’t be permitted.
19:20 stormchase it would be like the auto industry
19:20 stormchase destroyed!
19:20      prole yep
19:21      prole for the same reason: inferior product
19:23 stormchase what is the best car maker out there in your opinion?
19:23      prole the best? no idea
19:23      prole they are all pretty fucked

21:40 stormchase she reads on the screen
21:40 stormchase where i put left last job because of the sporadic and few work hours

21:41 stormchase so i ask her
21:41 stormchase is that why u really came in here
21:41 stormchase just to see what i'm doing on the computer
21:41 stormchase (which i believe)
21:41 stormchase she acts all fucking offended like i hurt her feelings
21:42 stormchase but that's everytime she comes in here
21:42      prole how long was she in there before she commented on the screen
21:42 stormchase 14 seconds
21:42      prole yea
21:42      prole she fakin prolly
21:42 stormchase cause whenever she comes in
21:42 stormchase she gotta get all close
21:43 stormchase cause she wears glasses
21:43 stormchase its so obvious
21:43      prole nice
21:44 stormchase it would be nice if she just asked once
21:44 stormchase just once
21:44 stormchase asked me
21:44      prole if she could look at the screen?
21:45 stormchase no just what i'm doing over there on the computer

22:32      prole itll never happen
22:32 stormchase sounds good tho
22:32      prole and in practice I dont know how well it would work because its easy to "lose" money from the budget
22:32      prole yea
22:32      prole theoretically it sounds really good
22:32      prole pratically I dunno
22:32      prole especially the funds being split up into tehcnology/treatment/etc
22:33      prole ideally I would want something like that but it would more than likely be something you could buy into if you wanted
22:33      prole that wouldnt directly eliminate insurance companies
22:34      prole what has the mtv done to you
22:35 stormchase they would still have auto and life

13:37      prole s/;/l
13:38      prole so why a new low
13:39 stormchase most of their movies are not good but they're not that fucking horrible
13:39 stormchase the scary movie series
13:39 stormchase white chicks
13:39 stormchase were kinda funny
13:39      prole scary movie was ok for the first 2
13:39      prole werent there like 6
13:39 stormchase this was just awful
13:40      prole well I mean
13:40      prole dance movies in the forst place are stupid as fuck
13:40      prole to make a spoof of a movie that is terrible to begin with is asking for a shitty movie
13:40 stormchase this is from somebody who watches those
13:40 stormchase so it must be really bad
13:40      prole damn
13:40      prole yea
13:40 stormchase is my point
13:40      prole yea
13:41      prole susan called me asking if I wanted to keep dominic tomorrow from 10am til ???
13:41      prole and she was going to a funeral in fl that started t 7pm
13:41      prole that is a 5 hour drive
13:41      prole and while I dont really care that she asked its fucked up to ask that shit the day prior
13:41      prole then be like if you say no I cant go
13:41      prole but my dad go to sleep at like 8pm and its fucked up she gave no notice other than tomorrow
13:41      prole otherwise I could have done it
13:42      prole but with no notice like that I cant do it
13:42 stormchase did u even ask your dad?
13:43 stormchase maybe he won't mind?
13:43      prole he's here I asked him
13:43 stormchase or is it just the principle?
13:43 stormchase and he said no?
13:43      prole no I asked him and he said nah
13:43      prole yea
13:43      prole well
13:43      prole he said 'if you ant find anyone else'
13:43      prole and I told her that and shes like forget it
13:44 stormchase funerals are usually unscheduled events/i know u know that
13:44      prole not one day notice unscheduled
13:44      prole especially when people are out of state
13:45      prole when I went to my grandfathers funeral it was like 2 days I think, maybe 3
13:45      prole more than 1 in any event
13:45 stormchase i am sure she has another support system in place
13:45 stormchase if not
13:46 stormchase sucks for her
13:46      prole yea
13:46      prole but I mean the thing she has to realise is
13:46      prole this isnt my house
13:46      prole so I cant just say yes to shit like that
13:46      prole and secondly there arent kids here other than when he is
13:46      prole so shit isnt kept up for kids thats why notice is needed to move shit around that he cant get into
13:50      prole do you watch that show jon and kate plus eight or whatever it is
13:51 stormchase i had in the past
13:51 stormchase not now
13:51      prole why you stop
13:51 stormchase once u got the family dynamic
13:51 stormchase it's the same
13:51 stormchase she is way too controlling and organized

13:54      prole well I dunno how fertility treatmens work I assume it is pills
13:54      prole its probably not

14:14 stormchase a notebook
14:14 stormchase or laptop
14:14      prole word?
14:14 stormchase his first time
14:14 stormchase he is a device virgin
14:14      prole does he know anything about computers?
14:15      prole becuse walmart splits heads sometimes
14:15 stormchase not a damn thing
14:15      prole well
14:15      prole a fool and his money are soon parted
14:15 stormchase how is best buy?
14:15      prole depends, some are decent deals and some are head busts
14:15      prole its like that everywhere
14:15 stormchase oh wee
14:15 stormchase ll
14:15      prole you need to know something about computers to differentiate
14:15 stormchase no luck there
14:16 stormchase i told him to send me the specs of whatever he finds
14:16      prole yea
14:16 stormchase this is how little he knows
14:16 stormchase he's doing this on his lunch break
14:16      prole is there a reaons he doesnt by it online
14:16      prole reason*
14:16 stormchase i told him u need to take a little time
14:17      prole just tell him to go to tigerdirect or newegg
14:17 stormchase wants a brick and mortar in case he hates it
14:17      prole they both have decent deals on computers sometimes
14:17      prole ah
14:17      prole thats dumb
14:17      prole and bestbuy charges a 15 or 20 percent restocking fee
14:17      prole walmart doesnt
14:17 stormchase he's going to walmart
14:18      prole shit might be different there but walmarts here dont have good selections of computers
14:18      prole why is he getting it anyway
14:18      prole like does he NEED a laptop
14:19      prole or does he just want to carry it around to look cool
14:19 stormchase the old one is acting up apparently
14:19      prole what I'm saying is you can get desktops for cheap
14:19      prole way cheaper than laptops
14:19 stormchase he is on phone now

14:24      prole the hdd space is not whats relevant
14:25      prole what is the processor speed and how much ram
14:25 stormchase what is good speed
14:25      prole at least 1.8/1 gb of ram at the very least
14:25      prole 2 gb of ram would be better seeing as it likely comes with vista
14:26      prole 1.8 being the processor speed
14:27      prole if it comes with xp 1gb of ram would be ok
14:27      prole but not good
14:27 stormchase 1g ddr2
14:27 stormchase ?

14:29      prole ?
14:30      prole cause if its a netbook with a 7 or 8 inch screen I wouldnt pay that
14:31      prole but for just going to a store thats gonna be the price
14:31 stormchase 6 by 8
14:32      prole yea thats about what they're going to cost in a store it isnt worth it to me
14:32      prole but if hes set on buying from a store he may as well get that
14:33 stormchase 11' hundred more
14:33      prole unsurpising
14:33      prole I dunno I remember when the netbooks came out they were running linux and 100 dollars
14:33      prole then niggas started buying them and people threw windows on them and jacked the price up byu 100 dollats

16:28 stormchase which is a lie
16:28 stormchase his response was on reddit
16:29 stormchase says he just wanted to get away
16:29      prole WASHINGTON (AFP) — South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford on Wednesday admitted conducting a months-long affair with an Argentine woman but refused to answer questions about whether he would resign from office.
16:29 stormchase he made that crap up i'm sure
16:29 stormchase oh ha
16:29 stormchase so we are both wonderfully right
16:29      prole yeas

16:30 stormchase exotic puss
16:30      prole after that shit they pulled with clinton

16:44      prole fuck it
16:44      prole I wonder what the statistics concerning shootings by cops and shooting by criminals are
16:44      prole like if you are more likely to be killed by a cop
16:44      prole then some nigga on the street
16:44      prole than
16:45 stormchase i bet he beats his girl/wife
16:45      prole likely
16:46      prole apparently he beat some other guy down earlier int he night
16:46      prole in the same bar
16:46      prole according to the bottom of the article anyway
16:46 stormchase most men just don't hit a strange woman unless they do that shit on the reg
16:46      prole yea
16:49      prole I need to run for some kind of office
16:49      prole I want police who are found guilty of murdering someone to get death automatically

13:40      carla not just me
13:40      carla you made me feel so bad
13:40      prole it would be fine if there was wireless anywhere here
13:40      prole I'm sying that in rural-ish georgia it doesnt make sense to get it
13:41      prole there arent enough hot spots

13:41      carla it stores the songs

13:45      prole something stupid probably
13:45      prole Tilt to sip, shake for foam, even pour iBeer from iPhone to iPhone. The award winning virtual pint of beer takes full advantage of iPhone's high-res screen, ...

13:46      prole told you
13:46      prole a lot of their apps are shit like that
13:47      prole that serves no purpose
13:47      prole its the type of shit that appeals to iphone users
13:47      prole 'the cult of apple'
13:47      prole which is basically niggas who will pay anything apple wants and defend anything apple does
13:48      prole if some apple employees came to one of these peoples house and raped their mother and told them it was research for the new 4g phone
13:48      prole they would be like oh ok
13:48      prole and shit
13:48      prole I mean people will straight argue with you that because apple makes it, a computer is worth 2 to 3 times more than a non-apple with equivalent hardware
13:49      prole and be serious as fuck about
13:49      prole it
13:49      prole like if you go to apples website, I dont think theres any computer there for under 1000 dollars
13:49      prole a 24 inch imac with 2 gb of ram was like 2400 dollars
13:49      carla i knew a guy like that once
13:49      prole which makes no fucking sense

13:50      prole they wanted 600 dollars
13:50      carla all he ever said was it was so intuitive
13:50      prole a gb of ram is like 50 bucks
13:50      carla it was like it was reading his mind
13:50      prole if not less
13:51      prole its not intuitive though
13:51      prole thats the thing
13:51      prole its just not windows
13:51      prole like all apps share one main bar for their menus
13:51      prole so if you have 5 windows open
13:51      prole the top bar will change with each window you focus
13:51      prole its trash
13:51      prole and then
13:51      prole seeing as their computers are all one giant unit
13:52      prole if the webcam breaks you have to send off the hole fucking computer to be fixed
13:52      prole whole*

14:44      prole when they strip searched that teenager looking for ibuprofen
14:44      prole 8-1 decision saying its illegal
14:44      prole I dont even know what to say that it wasnt unanimous
14:47      carla was reading the article about the stoned walla bies in australia
14:48      prole ah

14:49      prole because schools are dumb as fuck

14:51      carla she slanging that crack rock
14:51      prole In a dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas found the search legal and said the court previously had given school officials "considerable leeway" under the Fourth Amendment in school settings.
14:51      prole Officials had searched the girl's backpack and found nothing, Thomas said. "It was eminently reasonable to conclude the backpack was empty because Redding was secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would look," Thomas said.
14:51      prole Thomas warned that the majority's decision could backfire. "Redding would not have been the first person to conceal pills in her undergarments," he said. "Nor will she be the last after today's decision, which announces the safest place to secrete contraband in school."
14:51      prole fuck that guy
14:51      carla reading it now
14:52      carla fuck that

15:04      prole hehe
15:04      prole yep
15:04      prole (CNN) -- African-Americans really like President Obama, but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office, a new national poll found.
15:04      prole no shit
15:04      prole what the fuck were people expecting
15:05      carla relations are maybe worse
15:08      prole prolly

15:08      prole not bron in america
15:08      prole born*
15:08      prole that he killed his grandmother so she couldnt say that he isnt american
15:08      prole etc
15:13      prole and the fact someone black was elected to president stirred up a lot of resentment in people who were already racist
15:13      prole more people are vocal about the shit now
15:14      carla i knew i meant to share a random life experience
15:14      carla here goes
15:15      carla that shrink was a tree hugging nut
15:15      prole what shrink
15:15      carla the office was an old house converted to an office
15:15      carla the one who put me in the treatment program
15:15      carla the house is full of plants
15:16      carla i mean to point they block out the sun

15:17      prole yea it aint gonna happen
15:17      prole she got blowed and forgot
15:17      carla so this shit is a hustle
15:18      carla the law makes u go into treatment
15:18      carla but u can't legally make someone go
15:18      carla without a doc's consent
15:18      carla so automatically an industry is created
15:18      carla automatic referrals
15:18      carla from court system
15:19      prole yep
15:19      prole welcome to america

15:22      carla co-workers
15:22      carla family
15:22      carla whole bunch a shit
15:22      carla but anyway
15:22      carla i tell her
15:22      carla well if these ppl re-offend and kill somebody
15:22      carla they might come after you
15:23      carla and she's like hhhmmm
15:23      prole haha
15:23      carla one of her peers
15:23      carla told her
15:23      carla he would never
15:23      carla NOT refer anyone
15:23      carla he didn't say why
15:23      carla man
15:23      carla she said
15:23      carla she never thought of the liability
15:24      carla so then she's like
15:24      carla thanks
15:24      prole he said he'd never not refer someone because he gets paid
15:24      carla you've helped me more than i've helped u
15:24      prole nice
15:24      carla they get paid at that point anyway
15:24      carla there's no reason to refer every single person
15:25      prole because he probably has some thing where if the court/police send them to him they are obviously guilty
15:25      carla anyway random life experience shared

15:31      prole in late October of last year I was 1911 shopping, completely oblivious to the crazies and what they thought about the election. I was visiting every gun case within 50 miles of my apartment to see what they had new and used, and prices on .45ACP. I strolled into my 3rd Gander Mountain in one day and I'm walking up to the gun counter just in time to hear an employee telling 2 or 3 captive audience customers: "...yeah if he gets elected, he's gonna tax and ban all guns and ammo. Yup. He's gonna ban fishing too."

16:43      prole the glock and revolver ones are amusing
16:50      prole did you ever carry that beretta
16:50      prole like on your person or in the car
16:50      prole ?
16:50      carla yes
16:50      prole one in the chamber
16:50      prole ?
16:51      carla no/gun in the apt had one in the chamber/why?
16:51      prole just wondering
16:51      prole people always look at me weird when they ask to me see my gun and I take the bullet out of the chamber
16:52      prole like 'damn you waiting on someone to run up on you' or other dumb as comments
16:52      prole being that I carry it specifically in case someone runs up on me I would think its obvious
16:52      carla it is considered an unsafe practice
16:52      carla even by gun enthusiasts
16:52      prole if you are carrying it outside of a holster it is unsafe
16:52      prole no it isnt
16:53      carla why are u asking me
16:53      prole almost everyone carries with one in the chamber
16:53      carla fine
16:53      prole cause I dont know anyone else with guns
16:53      carla too ill to debate the damn issue
16:53      carla fuck it
16:53      prole a lot of the have manual safeties though
16:53      prole wasnt trying to deabte it
16:53      prole was just asking you

16:56      carla they'll get back to it
16:56      prole yeas
16:56      carla ncis is just more light hearted for daytime viewers
16:56      prole you still watching royal pains?
16:57      carla no
16:58      prole are you lying because you're ashamed

16:58      prole what pushed youover the edge
16:58      prole ah word
16:58      carla could predict the plot
16:59      prole hm that isnt what I would have thought
16:59      prole but from that one episode it was really formulaic
16:59      prole introduced the comic relief/love interest/etc
16:59      carla i mean to point i could create dialogue and it would be verbatim what i said
17:00      prole haha
17:00      prole thats a damn shame
17:00      prole but usa's original programming has never really been good
17:00      prole and btw http://www.thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291998
17:00      prole hmmm

17:00      prole or is it just ci
17:02      carla i don't think svu is on there
17:03      carla you are right about the guns
17:03      carla let the shit go
17:04      carla listen
17:04      carla i am not good company today

17:05      carla otc 
17:05      prole word
17:05      prole sounds broign for me
17:05      prole but before you go

17:07      prole I am highly allregic to it and I was thinking maybe that is where my hives come from but it would have gone by now I would think
17:07      prole word
17:07      prole dont berettas have a slide safety though
17:07      carla yes
17:07      prole word
17:07      carla that is why i did not keep mine that way
17:07      carla i kept practicing
17:07      carla until the movement was fluid and natural
17:07      carla to me
17:08      carla not the same as one in the chamber
17:08      carla i know
17:08      prole the whole reason I do is I saw a video of some dude
17:08      carla but it was what i was comfy with
17:08      prole and there were a bunch of people pulling him out of a car to whopp his ass
17:09      prole and he pulls a pistol and is trying to cock it
17:09      prole and they take him out and beat his ass before he can
17:09      prole noided me out
17:09      carla yes that could be a problem
17:09      prole plus with a glock you have to depress the safety in the trigger for it to fire
17:10      prole I have tried it cocked with an empty chamber pulling on the sides of the trigger
17:10      prole wont fire
17:10      prole so as long as its in a holster that covers the trigger its cool
17:10      prole and the revolver I dont really have a choice
17:11      carla i am going to try to log off
17:11      prole mk

17:06      carla ha

17:06      carla bogus

01:03      prole A few months ago, I was out with this hippie girl who lives in a tight knit neighborhood where people are always wandering around with open intoxicants and she mentioned one of her good neighbor friends was in the process of "purchasing bullets for machineguns or something," and she fumbled through some argument about how it's an investment because he's gonna sell it later when the prices go through the roof. I gently tried to explain that this guy is a little nutty in my book. 
01:03      prole I then laid out the following argument almost verbatim: "So there's the young urban male with a half a box of ammo and a revolver or a 9mm, not sure of his direction in life, and then there is the suburban to rural 30- and 40-somethings racking up hundreds or thousands of dollars of credit card debt buying guns and ammo and keeping it in their basement based on email forwards and unverified claims, making big financial decisions on pretty questionable facts." With a rhetorical and questioning sound in my voice, I stated, "I'm really thinking alot about who is more dangerous.."
01:03      prole She decided to respond to my rhetorical statement. "The black one."
01:03       jhea man

01:05      prole ok sec

12:11 stormchase well its not like i've been overrun with calls though
12:11 stormchase haven't lost a fish cause of it 
12:11 stormchase changing now though
12:12      prole word
12:14      prole http://www.surplusrifleforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=66812
12:14      prole dumbass
12:28 stormchase using reloads makes him a dumbass?
12:29      prole using reloads in a gun that is specifically said not to use reloads in does
12:29 stormchase oh it did?
12:29      prole and the fact that the manual wasnt read before he shot them
12:30      prole the manual said do not use reloads they void the wrranty
12:30      prole and 
12:30      prole if you read the replies thats what almost the whole first page is saying
12:30      prole and
12:30      prole in milsurp/other old ass shit you dont want to use reloads you didnt make
12:30      prole you buy surplus shit
12:31 stormchase you've never used reloads i take it
12:31      prole I use reloads in my pistol from the range
12:31 stormchase i didn't read the replies
12:31      prole its specifically a garand thing
12:31 stormchase and i know u aren't talking about not reading everything
12:31      prole the bullets they make for it now run too hot
12:32      prole so you need to either buy an adjustable gas valve
12:32      prole or lower loaded shit
12:32      prole or load your own
12:32      prole not buy range shit
12:32      prole cause thats usually loaded hotter
12:33      prole like the reloaded 357 I got from the range was kicking substantially harder than the sd hp ammo I had also
12:33      prole same with their 40 ball compared to the 40 hp I had
12:33      prole ranges just usually load their shit hot
12:33 stormchase make your own
12:33      prole and in a gun that cant handle high pressures, that is a bad thing
12:33 stormchase you can gunsmith from home
12:33      prole yep
12:33 stormchase new job for u
12:33 stormchase do it J!
12:34      prole reloading setup isnt expensive
12:34      prole like 300 buck
12:34 stormchase there's that guy in fvalley who has a gunshop in his house
12:34 stormchase i been there
12:34 stormchase out like past the cemetary i think
12:34      prole yea I know where you're alking about
12:34      prole he used to have a range he shut that down
12:35      prole I assume he still sells guns but I dunno
12:35 stormchase he needs some competition
12:35 stormchase there's a niche to be filled
12:35 stormchase do it
12:35      prole to sell guns I would need an ffl
12:35 stormchase how hard is that and expensive
12:35 stormchase do u know
12:35      prole but actually you just made me think of something
12:35 stormchase ?
12:35      prole there have been niggas around here asking me to buy bullets for them or to sell them some
12:35      prole I could do that shit
12:36      prole and its a lot of paperwork plus 200 dollars eveyr year
12:36 stormchase um and?
12:36      prole and if you say you have a store you get a annual visit from an atf agent
12:36      prole I think annual it may be semi-annual

12:36 stormchase i mean have a store

17:03      prole The New Rochelle Police Department is being sued by Demetrius Hazelton, the son a New Rochelle police detective, with support from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Hazelton, 17 and Class of '09 at New Rochelle High School (pictured right, click to enlarge image), was arrested after he allegedly mocked a white police officer using a "white racial monotone voice" which police claim is the same voice used by Dave Chappelle "when making fun of white people."
17:04      prole According to the police report, officers responded to noisy parties at the Hartley Houses complex April 13 and tried to break up an altercation there. After the crowd ignored police commands to calm down, the report said, an officer brandished a Taser and fired it in the air without a cartridge to show the crowd the device's electric shock.

23:05      prole jesus
23:05      prole this guy has no business having a chl
23:06      prole I am holding a box of bullets and the magazine in confusion. Well the bullets are shaped this way, and the magazine's top has a wide side, then slims down. That seems like the shape of the bullet so let's jam it in that way. After about three rounds I notice the bullets are forming a nice arch and are trying to pop out. Seems I'm loading these backwards. Off to a great start it seems. So I pull the bullets out, start to put them in the right way, all to the disconcerting "BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM" of my class-mates merrily firing away. I eventually put 12 bullets into the magazine and slide it in... slide it in, slide it WHY THE gently caress isn't this... I'm putting the magazine in backwards. gently caress...
23:06      prole I mean shit
23:08 stormchase ha
23:09      prole they approved his chl
23:09      prole as of now he's fired 11 shots
23:09      prole out of one gun
23:09      prole ever
23:09      prole and he's licensed to carry a fucking gun
23:09      prole I mean I hate gun laws but goddamn
23:09      prole if you cant load it you dont need to carry it
23:10 stormchase true
23:13      prole and like
23:13      prole how do you load the bullets backward AND put the clip in backward
23:13      prole I can see one or the other if you dont know shit
23:14      prole but both?
23:14      prole then he wants to get a 45 as his first gun :S
23:17 stormchase stupidity
23:17      prole nice inglorious basterds is coming out soon
23:17      prole gonna be good prolly
23:19      prole About this .22 deal. The instructor himself as well as the clerks at the store, and the people I've asked that aren't on SA have all said the same thing. Don't bother. The .22 is not going to handle anything like a .45, or really that much like a 9mm. "I might as well practice with my paint-ball gun." as the person who got me into all of this orginally put it half-jokingly.
23:19      prole because finding the biggest caliber (common) gun for your first gun COULDN'T make you develop bad habits
23:19      prole and 32 cents a round is much better than 30 bucks for a brick of 500 (expenisve)
23:20 stormchase yea promos for it been out long time
23:20      prole saw the first ad for it on tv today
23:20      prole The fact it also has no real safety (that vestigial trigger thing is bullshit) and I'm not very familiar with guns, atop the fact it's in internal firing mechanism with lots of tiny parts makes me just want to completely shun away from Glock.
23:20      prole idiot
23:21 stormchase make it out peter pete
23:21      prole GLOCK IS THE ONLY GUN WITH SMALL MOVING PARTS

23:27      prole shit is real
23:27      prole killin natzees
23:27 stormchase nice promo
23:29      prole I stuck my head in the coop and there was a huge raccoon there, waiting to have some delicious guinea dinner. I sprinted upstairs, grabbed the HK45 because I knew it was loaded, ran back outside, and popped back in the coop just as the 'coon was scaling the fence out of the place. I shot him from about 3' away, right in the gut with a .45 FMJ. He still crawled 25' before dying. If a .45 isn't an "omg knockdown instant kill!" for a 30 pound 'coon, it damned sure isn't going to knock a grown man onto his rear end and prevent him from doing you further harm.
23:29      prole stoppin powah!
23:31      prole people who hold onto hgihschool shit forever are dumb as fuck
23:32      prole see
23:32      prole joe pulled them niggas over in that video
23:33 stormchase you do so love gun threads don't u
23:33      prole I like guns and weed
23:33      prole peter goes out the window
23:37      prole The reason I want a .45 is because I know the history and it's purpose, and intend to use it for self defense. I intend to go for an armed security guard job. (I already know a bit of boxing and have taken self defense courses. I'm in shape and have a clean record and the starting pay is waaaay higher than what I'm getting now.) and the places I have spoken to that are hiring allow me to use my own gun as long as it's between 9mm and .45 (no 22s or .50s, etc). The standard issue is a 9mm and if I do one day have to shoot another person I'd rather they stay down, which as with the marines I have spoken with a .45 will certainly do. I'm also pretty strong so I'm not too worried about the kick.
23:37      prole MARINES TOLD ME
23:38      prole From what I've seen they're also only slightly more expensive than the smaller calibers. At the stores I've seen 9mm is 650-800 where the HK.45 I saw (using it as reference as it was the one I looked at at the time) was $999. 200 dollars for a lot more power doesn't sound too bad for me.
23:38      prole ugggggghhhhhhhhhhhh

23:57      prole Filipinos on narcotics that would shrug off regular pistol and rifle wounds. 
23:57      prole Hard to shoot a gun without an arm. The whole purpose of a .45 was to be a one-shot = Incapacitated gun.   
23:57      prole for why 45 was invented
23:57      prole from the new chl holder
23:57      prole  /facepalm

12:11 stormchase body gets accustomed
12:12 stormchase i went thru month long bitch mode for lack of dust
12:12 stormchase all in the head tho
12:13      prole what I meant was weed makes it feel better t least
12:13      prole considering its known for helping niggas with nausea
12:13 stormchase ah hell man
12:13 stormchase i worry
12:13 stormchase sounds chronic tho
12:13      prole my stomach has been fucked up since like
12:13      prole I was 18

12:14      prole they gve me prilosec and said I had an ulcer
12:14 stormchase so u have a coupla mystery ailments
12:14 stormchase ulcer
12:14 stormchase huh
12:15      prole thats what they said
12:15      prole I always assumed you were exaggerating about cops being dicks but time has proven you true, like some rear end in a top hat giving me a ticket right as I left my unit. I explained to him that I had been away for 5 months posted in Virginia, but he was just like "welp lol your registration is outdated gently caress you" which was bullshit, loving constables. Then, I took my CCW course from an ex-cop turned criminal justice professor, and everything he said, every anecdote he repeated, and every bit of advice he gave was basically how cops have the biggest boners over screwing people over because they don't have police powers. It was just constant "I AM THE MANIFESTATION OF DIVINE JUSTICE AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SNUFF OUT YOUR VERY LIFE, MORTAL HAHAHAHA" all the time
12:15      prole newsflash to white people: cops hate you
12:16 stormchase ha
12:16      prole fucking
12:16      prole ahve you ever seent eh bumper stickers that say 
12:16      prole support our troops at home and abroad
12:16      prole and have a picture of some army guy and a cop on it
12:16 stormchase yes
12:16 stormchase offends me
12:16      prole that shit is indicative of what is wrong with pigs in america
12:17      prole they arent fucking troops
12:17      prole exactly
12:17 stormchase and some troops too i bet
12:17      prole probably
12:17 stormchase bullies and wannabes with badges
12:17      prole yep
12:17      prole people who couldnt get into the army
12:17      prole and its not made better by DHS giving out cash to polie forces
12:18      prole has cops in nyc walking around with mp5s
12:18      prole and some town in bfe like kansas I think
12:18      prole they got a riot vehicle that is baically an apc
12:18      prole with a mounted machine gun on top
12:18      prole I guess in case al qaeda airlifts into the town
12:18      prole but regular people cant be trusted with machine guns
12:19 stormchase like my bro in law
12:19      prole after all they dont go through the rigorous psych exams cops do (they dont)
12:19 stormchase how he got to be chief
12:19      prole and they dont have the shooting ksills cops have
12:19      prole (shooting once a year to qualify)
12:19      prole how'd he get to be chief
12:19 stormchase one of a handful of black males with a degree in a po dunk town and he is good looking
12:19      prole killed the most minorities
12:19      prole ?
12:19 stormchase he's like 31
12:19 stormchase and chief
12:19      prole how
12:20 stormchase tests/years/no one else qualified
12:20      prole oh yea
12:20 stormchase but the above stated is enough man
12:20 stormchase is my point
12:20      prole gotcha
12:20      prole np:  Huong Vietnam
12:20      prole er
12:20      prole nevermind
12:20      prole that fucks up the question I was going to ask you
12:21      prole anyway I knew a vietnamese kid when I was young
12:21      prole his name was huy pham
12:21      prole pronounced lie quee
12:22 stormchase and
12:22      prole thats it
12:22      prole The past few times I have been stopped I have dealt with very nice officers. I got a ticket for my registration being 5 months over due and the officer was actually apologizing to me for having to give me a ticket.
12:22      prole apologising for giving you a ticket he didn't HAVE to give you in thef irst place
12:22      prole that mkes him cool yea
12:23 stormchase bout to go take a bath

19:51 stormchase yea there's the world and shit
19:51 stormchase who cares about that?
19:51      prole heh
19:52      prole It’s likely that the microscope of serious scientific scrutiny will turn disciplines such as fingerprint and ballistics analysis, which have long histories and large sample sizes, into stronger standards of evidence. But many other forensic disciplines may be classified as far less sound. Bite marks, footprints, tire tracks, handwriting, bloodstain patterns and other forms of analysis that suffer from multiple confounding variables could end up being used as exclusionary evidence or as qualified supporting evidence only. Some types of evidence may be completely discredited. That’s what happened with voiceprint analysis and lead analysis of bullets, which were popular forensic techniques until studies showed significant error rates. 
19:52 #high:    Overand@ prole: yeah/
19:55      prole Then 23 years old, he was brought to trial for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl. He had never been arrested before and was confident he’d be cleared. Yet he watched as forensics expert Elaine Pagliaro testified that two hairs found in Barnes’s pickup were microscopically similar to the victim’s. Pagliaro also noted that soil samples taken from the truck were consistent with dirt from the crime scene and even that a distinctive pattern from the victim’s jeans was similar to an imprint left on the truck.
19:55      prole Due largely to her testimony, Barnes was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Last year, he was cleared by DNA and released.
19:55      prole spent 20 years in jail

12:00 stormchase trying to live vicariously
12:01      prole no
12:05      prole WASHINGTON — After weeks of secretive talks, a bipartisan group in the Senate edged closer Monday to a health care compromise that omits two key Democratic priorities but incorporates provisions to slow the explosive rise in medical costs, officials said.
12:05      prole These officials said participants were on track to exclude a requirement many congressional Democrats seek for large businesses to offer coverage to their workers. Nor would there be a provision for a government insurance option, despite President Barack Obama's support for such a plan.
12:05      prole soooooo
12:05      prole how does this help anyone
12:07      prole Like bills drafted by Democrats, the proposal under discussion by the six Finance Committee members would bar insurance companies from denying coverage to any applicant. Nor could insurers charge higher premiums on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions.
12:07      prole But it jettisons other core Democratic provisions in a reach for bipartisanship on an issue that has so far produced little.
12:07      prole and
12:07      prole everytime I see 'bipartisan' they are always fuking over democrats
12:07      prole every single time

17:20      prole man
17:20      prole did you ever watch the hurt locker?
17:21      prole cause its on some mary sue bullshit
21:34 stormchase what is mary sue bullshit?
21:45      prole it means
21:45      prole the main character is over-glorified and has little or no flaws
21:45      prole A Mary Sue (sometimes just Sue), in literary criticism and particularly in fanfiction, is a fictional character with overly idealized and hackneyed mannerisms, lacking noteworthy flaws, and primarily functioning as wish-fulfillment fantasies for their authors or readers. Perhaps the single underlying feature of all characters described as "Mary Sues" is that they are too ostentatious for the audience's taste, or that the author seems to favor the character too highly. The author may seem to push how exceptional and wonderful the "Mary Sue" character is on his or her audience, sometimes leading the audience to dislike or even resent the character fairly quickly; such a character could be described as an "author's pet".
21:46      prole in my view anyway
21:46      prole cause in the beginning the main character is replacing someone
21:46      prole and he comes in all like "ARMY RANGER AMERICA FUCK YEA"
21:46      prole and its like that through the whole movie
21:46      prole you'll see I dunno
21:47 stormchase i suppose

23:20      prole racist
23:21    Chris-- hey dude, im curious about that stats page....what software do you use to generate the stats and the web page there?
23:23      prole http://royale.zerezo.com/irssistats/
23:23      prole it creates an html file from the logs
23:23      prole irssi specific though
23:23      prole there is another called pisog I believe
23:23    Chris-- hmm
23:23      prole that can do other programs
23:24    Chris-- well i have an eggdrop bot running on one server and its got a stats plugin, but it sucks pretty bad
23:24      prole yea I have a specific client that does nothing other than log the channel
23:24      prole but
23:24      prole http://pisg.sourceforge.net/
23:24      prole can handle eggdrop logs
23:25    Chris-- www.retrospective.us:8080/stats.htm
23:25    Chris-- its pretty gross.
23:25      carla barking right at u J
23:25      prole o yea thats rough
23:25    Chris-- how good is the pisg web page?
23:26    Chris-- oh shit hte page looks WAY better than it used to
23:26    Chris-- wow
23:26    Chris-- (still crap tho)
23:26      prole there are examples on the site, but the one I use is a pisg clone
23:26      prole http://elanor.mine.nu/daeron/script.fi.html
23:26      prole thats one example though
23:26      prole haha
23:26    Chris-- you see, the one you have for #high and that last link are examples of what im lookin for
23:27    Chris-- if i can find a GOOD eggdrop plugin, id use it in a heartbeat
23:27      prole well
23:27      prole I would say go with pisg cause like I said it supports eggdrop logs, you'd just have to turn logging on if it isn't already
23:28      prole and that will output like mine or the other one
23:28    Chris-- which is no biggie
23:28      prole well bye then
23:28    Chris-- holy shit
23:28      carla you gone?

22:53      prole In May 2009, the US FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis tested the contents of cartridges by two vendors. Trace amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) were detected in cartridges with higher nicotine content. Of the 18 varieties of cartridge tested by the FDA, one was found to contain diethylene glycol (DEG) in a 1% concentration. Further concerns were raised over inconsistent amounts of nicotine delivered when drawing on the device.[5] Citing these findings the FDA issued a press release in July 2009 strongly discouraging the use of electronic cigarettes and repeating previously stated concerns that electronic cigarettes are marketed to young people and lack appropriate health warnings.[6]

13:03 stormchase of hindsight is 20/20 but damn
13:06      prole yea
13:06      prole thats obviously a setup
13:12 stormchase oh and in this one interview he has
13:12 stormchase the muslim dude blames the jews for 911
13:12 stormchase and the muslim guy asks if he is a christian
13:12 stormchase and the dumb fuck tells him he is a jew
13:13 stormchase he also said 4,000 jews that normally would've been at work that day just didn't show up

13:22 stormchase i meant why is just that area swollen

13:38 stormchase i noticed that there are these companies popping up
13:38 stormchase all  over the nation buying back gold
13:38 stormchase they've always been there
13:38      prole gold is worth a lot right now
13:38 stormchase but now its gotten agressive
13:38      prole http://incredimazing.com/page/Early_Indoctrination_a_Science_Project
13:38 stormchase g
13:38      prole hahahahahahahahahahaha
13:38      prole look at that
13:39 stormchase alrighty then
13:39 stormchase those buy back programs have become mobile
13:40 stormchase like the hosting of car and gun shows type of thing
13:40      prole trash
13:40      prole thewy will never get my guns
13:40      prole uunless they start paying high p[rices
13:40      prole I'd go buy a bunch of jennings
13:40      prole sell them for more than what I piad
13:40      prole paid
13:40 stormchase my point is i think the govt is buying back the gold
13:40      prole oh
13:40      prole maybe
13:40      prole I mean thye need cash
13:41      prole the head of the fed said that if they got audited the economy would crash
13:41      prole its because we've just been printing money
13:41      prole ussr style
13:41 stormchase i've noticed the buying back get ridiculous in the last 5 years
13:41 stormchase trying to get even close to gold standard
13:42 stormchase would take harvesting it back from the nation
13:42      prole well
13:42      prole gold is at its highest price in a while
13:42      prole its just another bubble though
13:42      prole if you were buying gold years back you can make mad cash
13:42      prole if you buy it now you aint gonna make shit really
13:42 stormchase are you still missing...who sets the price of gold
13:43 stormchase they want u to sell it to them
13:43 stormchase for the printed bs money
13:43      prole its set by demand, noone sets it perse
13:43      prole like stock pricing
13:43 stormchase ok
13:43 stormchase not gonna get anywhere with you on that
13:44 stormchase you know for such a supposed free thinker you have a closed mind dear
13:44      prole I see what you are saying but your logic is flawed
13:44      prole that is more of a conspiracy theory type thing
13:45 stormchase alrighty then/and there's never actually been one of those in our govt.
13:45      prole a company that buys gold?
13:45      prole maybe
13:45 stormchase not a single one/there's a fresh new gang of them /the number is getting to be like mcdonald's 
13:45      prole I said maybe
13:46 stormchase but oh well back to the show
13:46      prole but the point I am making is this
13:46      prole housing prices went up and up over a set of years
13:46      prole and then they bottomed out because it was the 'housing bubble'
13:46      prole same with tech stocks in the early 00s
13:46      prole smae thing will happen with gold
13:46      prole thats just how it works
13:46      prole oil prices did the same thing a few years back
13:46      prole when shit was at over 4 a gallon
13:47 stormchase i am not talking about supply and demand and economics theory
13:47 stormchase not that deep
13:47 stormchase just the mere acquisition of a raw material
13:47 stormchase through VARIOUS means
13:48      prole well I mean what do you think the end is
13:48      prole to pay off debt to china
13:48      prole to reaplly gold standard for coinage
13:48      prole or what
13:48      prole reapply*
13:49      prole shit
13:50 stormchase so mocking helps you how? cash on hand is measured in what air? the value of the dollar is based on what? diamonds?
13:50      prole I'm not mocking you I am asking you
13:51      prole you said the government is trying to buy up gold I was honestly asking you what ends they are trying to achieve
13:51 stormchase to prevent the collapse of an economy with a worthless dollar
13:51      prole also check your gmail
13:51      prole I think they are more inclinced to let that happen
13:51      prole I'd be more inclined to say that the spending the government has been doping has been intentional
13:51      prole in order to form an american eu equivalent
13:52      prole and the value of the dollar isnt based on anything
13:52      prole it was based on gold
13:52      prole and silver I think
13:52      prole but nixon (I think) did away with that
13:52 stormchase which is my point
13:52 stormchase ok then 
13:52 stormchase you are right
13:52 stormchase fuck it
13:52 stormchase you can't be talked to
13:52 stormchase you won't
13:52 stormchase even try
13:53      prole After the Second World War, a system similar to a Gold Standard was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements. Under this system, many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. promised to fix the price of gold at $35 per ounce. Implicitly, then, all currencies pegged to the dollar also had a fixed value in terms of gold. Under the regime of the French President Charles de Gaulle up to 1970, France reduced its dollar reserves, trading them for gold from the U.S. government, thereby reducing U.S. economic influence abroad. This, along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the Vietnam War, led President Richard Nixon to eliminate the fixed gold price in 1971, causing the system to break down.

12:41      prole The City Council in Grand Junction, Colo., has been considering a ban on begging, and at the end of June, Tempe, Ariz., carried out a four-day crackdown on the indigent. How do you know when someone is indigent? As a Las Vegas statute puts it, “An indigent person is a person whom a reasonable ordinary person would believe to be entitled to apply for or receive” public assistance.
12:41      prole nice
12:44      prole The viciousness of the official animus toward the indigent can be breathtaking. A few years ago, a group called Food Not Bombs started handing out free vegan food to hungry people in public parks around the nation. A number of cities, led by Las Vegas, passed ordinances forbidding the sharing of food with the indigent in public places, and several members of the group were arrested. A federal judge just overturned the anti-sharing law in Orlando, Fla., but the city is appealing. And now Middletown, Conn., is cracking down on food sharing.
12:44      prole heh wtf

15:28 #archlinux:     fryguy  ebirtaid: or a tabbed layout
15:29 #archlinux:     fryguy  ebirtaid: that's a failure of your wm, not a failure of tiling wms

12:25 stormchase i take it that the topic is pornography
12:26      prole yea
12:27 stormchase is it the weirdness of the porn or the porn itself?
12:27      prole well
12:27      prole a while back when jovie had first moved to gray her mom cut the internet off because her husband downloaded a bunch of porn
12:28      prole and I guess he said that he wouldnt keep it in the house anymore
12:28      prole so now today her mom is cleaning
12:28      prole and finds the stash of it
12:28      prole and on top of it being there at all
12:28      prole its also like some fetish shit

12:30      prole donnie is her stepdad
12:30      prole and not parent to either of the kids
12:30      prole but he also has 2 or 3 kids of his own
12:33 stormchase i was just wondering whether if it was regular porn would it be ok or was it the sheer volume of it before that was scary
12:34      prole well I dunno what he was looking at the first time but from what I understand jovies mom bitches regardless
12:34      prole I dont see the big deal
12:34      prole just porn

14:40 stormchase fuck with ya
14:40      prole man I'm bout to just not watch
14:40      prole and wait for a proper-er rip
14:42 stormchase i can figure out whats going on tho
14:42 stormchase and they lapse into english
14:42 stormchase mad at quentin for this
14:43 stormchase american movie that "lapses" into english
14:43      prole the subs are just not proper is all
14:43      prole oh
14:43      prole well
14:43      prole I mean its not based in america
14:43 stormchase that's never stop AMERICAN movie makers before
14:44 stormchase fuck realism
14:44 stormchase movies are meant to escape...damn
14:44 stormchase if i want real i'd watch a documentarh
14:44      prole eh
14:44 stormchase ry
14:44      prole there are better forms of escapism
14:44      prole I hate when movies are set in other countries and they all speak english
14:45 stormchase such as
14:45      prole unless it isnt necessary for them not to be
14:45      prole I can think of any offhand
14:45      prole but I know i have seen them
14:45      prole like
14:45 stormchase so you want to hear all that shit
14:45      prole I think a good bit of taken was in english when it should not have been
14:45      prole but they also had a lot of subs
14:45      prole and I watch fopreign movies so subs dont bother me so yes I do
14:46 stormchase this ISN'T 
14:46 stormchase a foreign film
14:46 stormchase is my point
14:46      prole but its set in a foreign place
14:46      prole is mine
14:46 stormchase are you just pretending
14:47 stormchase not to get my point
14:47 stormchase or are you just being difficult on purpose
14:47      prole you point is an american movie should be in english yes?
14:47 stormchase YES
14:47      prole my point is that regardless of where the movie is made, its setting and charcters should dictate the language
14:47 stormchase or just release and market it as such
14:47 stormchase fuck it
14:47 stormchase nevermind
14:47      prole if a movie is set in hong kong and made in france, they should speak chinese
14:47      prole etc
14:48 stormchase i don't know why even try with you
14:48      prole thats juts my opinion
14:48      prole look
14:48      prole my reasoning is it lends validity
14:48      prole your reasoning is that you dont want to read subs because it isnt a documentary
14:48      prole so there isnt a necessary modicum of realism
14:48      prole so we disagree on a fundemental point
14:48 stormchase fuck validity
14:48      prole arguing about it wont acocmplish anything
14:48 stormchase its  A MOVIE
14:48      prole because we are operating on two ifferent premises
14:49 stormchase I see that
14:50      prole this nigga is whining about 8-10 dollars is too expensive for a hiarcut
14:50      prole but he wont cut it himself because he doesnt want to fuck it up
14:50      prole it is annoying
14:51      prole because my theory is this
14:51      prole 8-10 dollars IS too much to shave your head
14:51      prole or something along the same lines
14:51      prole but if you are styling it to a point whre it is fuck-up-able
14:51      prole then 8 bucks isnt much
14:58 stormchase suspension of disbelief
14:58 stormchase been trying to think of that shit for 5 minutes now
15:03      prole haha
15:07     famine macon?
15:07      prole what

15:09     famine but the end result = high
15:09      prole eh another day
15:09     famine nod
15:09      prole well
15:09      prole if you wanna drive we can go cause thats the main reason I dont feel like it
15:10      prole cause I gotta get an oil change
15:10      prole and fuck with the tires put air in them and shit
15:10      prole dont feel like doing it
15:10      prole plus I think I dont have the gas
15:11 stormchase man
15:11      prole que
15:11 stormchase they bring up the fact that americans don't speak
15:11 stormchase any other languages

18:38      prole Inhofe said public opinion and information provided by news media have helped him become a staunch non-supporter of the bill. He said he would prefer waiting until after mid-term elections to enact reforms. He did not say nothing should be done. He simply feels that a topic as important as healthcare should not be rushed through the Senate or House of Representatives.
18:38      prole er

18:38      prole At a town hall meeting Wednesday Sen. Jim Inhofe told Chickasha residents he does not need to read the 1,000 page health care reform bill, he will simply vote against it.
18:38      prole "I don't have to read it, or know what's in it. I'm going to oppose it anyways," he said.

13:44 stormchase i never knew it was on first of all
13:44 stormchase no commercials
13:44      prole yea I had never heard of it
13:44      prole they supposedly failed at marketing it
13:44      prole and if I am not confusing it with something else
13:44      prole they cancelled it, brought i back
13:44      prole and got no ratings or whatever
13:45      prole so they cancelled it again
13:45 stormchase joss pissed somebody off
13:45      prole but I could  be thinking of something else
13:45 stormchase got the big head
13:45      prole yea
13:45 stormchase cause they keep bullshit on if they want to
13:45 stormchase like i heard the first 2 years of frasier
13:46 stormchase nobody watched that shit
13:46      prole fraiesr was boring
13:46      prole but then again I dont really like shows like that
13:46 stormchase but it found its niche audience/they gave it time to find them
13:46      prole yea
13:47 stormchase cause we know
13:47 stormchase if battlestar galactica
13:47 stormchase had multiple
13:47 stormchase seasons
13:47 stormchase this could
13:47 stormchase and it sucked

13:48      prole maybe those were the only two
13:48      prole but yea I dont watch that shit it seems lame
13:48 stormchase which is my point
13:49 stormchase battlestar got hyped
13:49 stormchase so if you "wanted" to see it
13:49 stormchase you knew when it was on and what channel
13:49      prole joss whedon fans get all irate that they never put enough ads for his shows up
13:49 stormchase they should
13:49      prole yea
13:49 stormchase cause i'd have watched
